    <p class="complete_description">
        She is described as "the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that
        remained in Middle-earth". During the War of the Ring, she revealed to
        Frodo Baggins that she was the bearer of Nenya. After the War, she
        returned to Valinor.

        Galadriel was born in Valinor as one of the Noldor, being the daughter
        of Finarfin and younger sister to Finrod Felagund (later King of
        Nargothrond), Angrod, and Aegnor. She took part in the Exile of the
        Noldor, supporting Fëanor. However she opposed the Kinslaying at
        Alqualondë and crossed the Helcaraxë with the rest of her group.
    </p>
    <p class="complete_description">
        After arriving in Beleriand, she lived in both Nargothrond and Doriath,
        the latter where she befriended Melian. Later, with her husband
        Celeborn, she ruled over the woodland Elves of Lothlórien, and together
        they had a daughter, Celebrían, who married Elrond.
